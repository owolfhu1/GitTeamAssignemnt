    + Already fork this 
- team lead gives access to repo

- team clones repo
    - clone will get a copy of the repo on your computer
    - + additionally shared the copy of the code

### Problem:
- head over to `src/TeamAssignment.java`
- you will see 6 comments describing methods
    - each team will take one assignment (someone may need to take 2) these assignments are various difficulties so discuss with th team who feels comfortable doing which problems
- now each team member will create a branch and solve the problem assigned to them
- team members will need to create PRs to merge their code into the main branch
- team members will review their colleague's code
    - if something seems wrong, leave a comment and mark the PR as not ready
    - if it looks good, approve the PR
- when 2 people have approved the PR, merge PR
- assignment is finished when all team members have merged their solutions and the TeamAssignment methods are all implemented
